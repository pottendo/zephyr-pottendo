Migration guide to Zephyr v3.6.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required or recommended when migrating your
application from Zephyr v3.5.0 to Zephyr v3.6.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_3.6>`.

Required changes
****************

Kernel
======

C Library
=========

Optional Modules
================

The following modules have been made optional and are not downloaded with `west update` by default
anymore:

* ``canopennode``

To enable them again use the ``west config manifest.project-filter -- +<module
name>`` command, or ``west config manifest.group-filter -- +optional`` to
enable all optional modules, and then run ``west update`` again.

Device Drivers and Device Tree
==============================

Power Management
================

Bootloader
==========

Bluetooth
=========

* The HCI implementation for both the Host and the Controller sides has been
  renamed for the IPC transport. The ``CONFIG_BT_RPMSG`` Kconfig option is now
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_IPC`, and the ``zephyr,bt-hci-rpmsg-ipc``
  Devicetree chosen is now ``zephyr,bt-hci-ipc``. The existing sample has also
  been renamed, from ``samples/bluetooth/hci_rpmsg`` to
  ``samples/bluetooth/hci_ipc``.

Networking
==========

Other Subsystems
================

* MCUmgr applications that make use of serial transports (shell or UART) must now select
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CRC`, this was previously erroneously selected if MCUmgr was enabled,
  when for non-serial transports it was not needed.
